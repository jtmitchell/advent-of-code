## Puzzle 1
Scan the ranges of product IDs for the "silly" values.
So, 55 (5 twice), 6464 (64 twice), and 123123 (123 twice) would all be invalid IDs.

Return the result of adding together all the invalid IDs.

## Puzzle 2
"Silly" values are now two or more repeats of a repeating number sequence.
So, 12341234 (1234 two times), 123123123 (123 three times), 1212121212 (12 five times), and 1111111 (1 seven times) are all invalid IDs.

Return the result of adding together all the invalid IDs.
